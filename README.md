Narrative:
| Player finds a letter that simply says "Dear [], Thank you. Sincerely, []."
| Options arise: (1) Write a letter back; (2) No action
| If (1), Player is informed that they can write a letter immediately, or wait until later.
| If (2) Player receives no additional prompt.
| In any case, Player is left to their own exploratory impulses - lots of things in the room to interact with, and lots of rooms to explore beyond - until they reach the last room
| Last room contains a mailbox; offers an opportunity to revise the letter if one was written earlier, an option to send the letter via mailbox, an option to write a letter if one chose to initially wait for later or take no action, an option to send a text to the letter sender via phone, an option to phone call the letter sender, an option to leave the room and visit the letter sender in-person, and an option to leave the room without any specific intention
| leaving the last room ends the game
| sending a letter, texting, and leavin gthe room for an in-person visit do not involve any response from the sender

| *details about the letter sender regarding history and relationship with the Player are TBD
