# AThankYouLetter
A 3D platformer game filled with sentiments gratitude, created as a personal project for skill development.

Game core concept: traveling to and through unknown enclaves by receiving support from and giving support to others.

Status: In Progress.

Anticipated release date: Spring 2024.

DESIGN NOTES:

Environments: Scene environments differ in terms of different game mechanics that need to be engaged in to move the character and/or to transition to the next stage. Stepping in certain spots in environments prompt certain events, and interactions with certain entities prompt certain events.
Character design: amorphous, black, wispy, person-like avatar; 1st person.

Narrative:
| Player finds a letter that simply says "Dear [], Thank you. Sincerely, []."
| Options arise: (1) Write a letter back; (2) No action
| If (1), Player is informed that they can write a letter immediately, or wait until later.
| If (2) Player receives no additional prompt.
| In any case, Player is left to their own exploratory impulses - lots of things in the room to interact with, and lots of rooms to explore beyond - until they reach the last room
| Last room contains a mailbox; offers an opportunity to revise the letter if one was written earlier, an option to send the letter via mailbox, an option to write a letter if one chose to initially wait for later or take no action, an option to send a text to the letter sender via phone, an option to phone call the letter sender, an option to leave the room and visit the letter sender in-person, and an option to leave the room without any specific intention
| leaving the last room ends the game
| sending a letter, texting, and leavin gthe room for an in-person visit do not involve any response from the sender
| phone call and video call results in a response from the sender
| only one option can be selected; Player must restart the game to experience other options
| *details about the letter sender regarding history and relationship with the Player are TBD
| *All rooms were previously traveled through by the sender, and offer info about the letter sender and their relationship with the Player
| **All rooms have objects and at least one activity
